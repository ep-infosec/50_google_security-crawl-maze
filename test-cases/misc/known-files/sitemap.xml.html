<h1> sitemap file </h1>
<p>
  The Sitemaps protocol allows a webmaster to inform search engines about URLs on a website that are available for crawling.
  A Sitemap is an XML file that lists the URLs for a site. This allows search engines to crawl the site more efficiently
  and to find URLs that may be isolated from rest of the site's content.
  The file contains a path which should be discovered by security crawlers.
