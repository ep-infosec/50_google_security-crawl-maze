<h1> Content-Location header </h1>
<p>
  The Content-Location header indicates an alternate location for the returned data.
  The principal use is to indicate the URL of a resource transmitted as the result of content negotiation.
  Content-Location indicates the direct URL to use to access the resource, without further content negotiation in the future.
  The response contains the header with a link which should be discovered by security crawlers.
